# Security model

tabEE moves user data between two independently operated web applications. The
receiver is the party at risk: it is asked to interpret bytes produced by a
stranger. v0.3 therefore assumes:

- the **sender is untrusted**;
- the **receiver's origin and code are trusted by the receiver's own user**;
- the browser authenticates origins; tabEE never invents identity;
- TLS protects the channel; tabEE adds no confidentiality of its own.

## 1. Threat table

| Threat | Control | Residual risk |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A page opens a tabEE receiver and silently extracts its data | Receiver requires explicit user approval with bundle name, total size, every file name/format/size, and verified origin; `accept` is only called after that decision. | A user can approve a malicious transfer. |
| A hostile receiver phishes the sender | Sender shows the destination origin before/while opening; no credentials, cookies, or local data are sent during discovery; nothing is released until the receiver approves. | The receiving tab is still a separate window; users must read the origin. |
| A third window injects messages into an active session | The bootstrap accepts only `event.source === window.opener` with a matching 128-bit nonce; the transport pins the verified origin and the nonce-derived channel. | Compromise of either origin's code, or a browser extension, defeats this. |
| Origin spoofing in metadata | The receiver compares `offer.sender.origin` with the origin observed on the transport; disagreement is `ORIGIN_MISMATCH`. The consent dialog displays only the verified origin. | Claimed `application.name` remains unverified text. |
| Replaying an invitation | Nonce is single-use, bound to one channel, stripped from the URL after the handshake; offers expire; a transfer id cannot be reused. | A captured nonce is useless without the opener window; no replay window is open in the reference implementation. |
| Oversized payloads or memory exhaustion | Sender advertises and enforces limits; receiver checks the declared total, per-file sizes, per-format sums, and file counts **before** consent, then re-measures every file and the total; absolute caps on capability lists, file count (16), and metadata lengths. | No streaming, no rate limiting: many small offers are not throttled in v0.3. |
| Detaching the sender's own buffer | The SDK copies binary exports into a fresh `ArrayBuffer` before transferring; the application's memory is never detached. | Extra copy up to the size limit. |
| Markup injection through metadata | Bundle names, file names, application names, origins, and error messages are inserted with `textContent`; the dialog lives in a shadow root so host CSS cannot spoof its controls. | Applications must not render payload content as HTML. |
| COOP severs the opener | Detected: the receiver reports `OPENER_UNAVAILABLE`; the sender times out. The SDK never relaxes site isolation. | Sites with strict COOP simply cannot use new-window transport in v0.3. |
| Window blockers | Explicit `POPUP_BLOCKED` before any network or message activity. | Users may not understand why nothing opened. |
| Metadata abuse | File metadata is JSON-only, normalized into plain objects, capped per file (16 KiB, depth 8, 64 keys, 256 array entries), and compared between offer and payload. | Semantic meaning is application-specific; a receiver must not trust metadata fields. |
| Malformed or hostile protocol data | Every inbound structure is validated (`validateCapabilities`, `validateOffer`, `validateTransferRequest`, `validateCancelRequest`) and unknown fields are dropped, not forwarded. | Validation is structural, not semantic. |
| Import adapter crashes on hostile content | Adapter exceptions become `IMPORT_FAILED`; nothing is retried. | Dataset semantics are the application's responsibility. |

## 2. Origin binding

Three checks must all hold for a session:

1. **Bootstrap source**: `event.source === window.opener` on the receiver, and
   `event.source` equal to the window the sender opened, on the sender side.
2. **Nonce**: `tabee-sid` in the receiver's fragment equals the nonce in the
   hello; the nonce selects the transport channel.
3. **Origin**: taken from `MessageEvent.origin`, then pinned as the only allowed
   origin for the connection. In the reference implementation this is Penpal's
   `allowedOrigins: [verifiedOrigin]` — never `"*"` and never a regex.

The destination's origin is derived from the URL the user typed, after transport
policy checks. The sender refuses any hello-ack from a different origin, which
also covers redirects to another site.

## 3. Consent

The receiving application MUST show, before accepting:

- the bundle name as provided by the sender, escaped;
- the total byte size, and every file with its name, format identifier/label,
  and byte size;
- the sender's verified origin and claimed application name, clearly separated.

Per-file metadata is not required in the consent prompt. If an application
chooses to show it, it MUST be rendered as text (never HTML) and MUST be
truncated to a bounded length.

The built-in dialog states that a successful handshake does not make the sender
trustworthy. A receiver may replace the dialog, but must keep the same
information and must default to deny on error, timeout, or dismissal.

`accept` is the only path from `OFFERED` to `ACCEPTED`; the state machine
rejects every other transition.

## 4. Data handling rules

- File metadata is normalized to plain JSON with per-file bounds; prototype
  keys are rejected. The payload must repeat the offer's metadata exactly
  (canonical comparison), so approval covers the metadata the adapter receives.
- Every file's format and schema are matched per file before consent; mixed
  formats require an application-level bundle import path.
- Every declared file size, per-format sum, and the total are checked from
  metadata before the payload exists, then measured again from the received
  values; the offer and the transfer declaration must both agree with the
  actual bytes.
- A payload whose file set differs from the accepted offer (missing, extra,
  renamed, or re-formatted files) is rejected before any adapter runs.
- Text payloads are measured in UTF-8 bytes without allocating an encoded copy.
- Binary payloads are copied into a new buffer, then transferred, so a hostile
  or careless export adapter cannot cause detachment of live application memory.
- Import adapters receive the files of their format (`string` or `ArrayBuffer`
  per file) and a context object with the transfer id, verified origin, sender
  name, and the full bundle manifest. They must validate semantics themselves.
- The SDK keeps at most 16 transfer records per receiving window and one
  connection per invitation.

## 5. Known gaps (v0.3)

- **No sender identity.** Any page can claim any `application.name`. Only the
  origin is authenticated, and only by the browser.
- **No payload integrity check.** TLS protects transit; there is no signature or
  checksum. A compromised receiver page can accept anything.
- **No confidentiality from the receiver's own origin.** The receiving
  application, and any script it loads, sees the bundle.
- **Same-origin applications are not isolated.** If both apps share an origin,
  browser origin checks cannot distinguish them.
- **No rate limiting or quotas.** A local app can be offered many sessions.
- **No chunking.** One bundle is limited to one message (10 MB total by
  default, 16 files).
- **No per-file approval.** The human approves the whole bundle; individual
  files cannot be accepted or rejected separately.
- **Mixed bundles need an application path.** A receiver without a bundle-level
  import handler rejects mixed-format offers rather than silently dropping
  formats.
- **The invitation fragment is visible to the receiving page.** It contains only
  a random nonce.
- **Browser extensions and compromised pages** are outside the model.

## 6. Implementation guidance

- Keep the receiver page free of third-party scripts; the consent boundary is
  only as strong as the page that renders it.
- Add a Content Security Policy; the SDK needs no `eval`, no inline handlers,
  and no external requests.
- Never log payloads or dataset contents; log codes and sizes.
- Treat all sender-supplied strings as text, never markup.
- Do not auto-approve, batch-approve, or remember approvals for a different
  origin.
